# Vision_Translator
A project that takes image of German text as input and outputs the English translation. The project uses EAST and Tesseract for text detection and OCR followed by an LSTM model which translates the detected text to english. The LSTM translator model used is available in my repo: https://github.com/axe76/Neural-translator.-. The model has been trained on a small dataset with a mediocre laptop and hence will not accurately translate complex sentences.
